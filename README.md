# Upload external tox JSON report to DevPI

This script is inspired [from following StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/59518800/3830926) which seeks some way to upload `toxresult.json` (generated by [tox automation tool](https://tox.wiki/)) to [local devpi server](https://devpi.net/).

## CAVEAT

For now the script is _really_ crude, it just worked for me at some point, and personally I don't even use it now. Maybe somebody can improve it, or hammer it into a devpi plugin. (Is there really no need for uploading test results into devpi?)

## Usage
`--debug`, `--index` and `-v` options should be properly propagated to devpi internal, while `-r` and `--dry-run` are local arguments.
